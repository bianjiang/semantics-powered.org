          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Biomedical ontologies and controlled terminologies provide structured domain knowledge to a variety of health information systems. The rich thesaurus with concepts linked by semantic relationships has been widely used in natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, semantic annotation, and automated reasoning. The dramatically increasing amount of health-related data poses unprecedented opportunities for mining previously unknown knowledge with semantics-powered data mining and analytics methods. However, due to the heterogeneity of different data sources, it is a challenging problem to exploit multiple sources to solve real-world problems such as designing cost-effective treatment plan for patients, designing generalizable clinical trials, drug repurposing, and clinical phenotyping. The goal of this workshop is to bring people in the field of ontologies, data mining, knowledge representation, knowledge management, and data analytics to discuss innovative semantic methods, applications, and data analytics to address problems in healthcare, biomedicine, public health, and clinical research with biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social web data. We are inviting original research submissions as well as work-in-progress. Selected full papers will be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue of a premier journal in biomedical informatics.</p>


          <p>SEPDA has been established as a key venue for disseminating research on health data analytics using semantic web technologies such as ontologies. In the past few years, we have seen an increasing interest in using semantic web technologies for health data analysis with more and more submissions that present novel methods and applications for linked open data, information extraction, semantic-web-based knowledge bases, and deep learning. The NIH Data Science Strategic Plan explicitly commits to ensuring that all data-science activities and products supported by the agency adhere to the FAIR principles, meaning that data be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Semantic web technologies play a crucial role to address the FAIR principles. With the infrastructure support such as NCBO’s BioPortal for ontology maintenance, the CEDAR software for metadata creation and validation, more and more researchers are using ontologies and semantic web technologies for knowledge representation, semantic inference, natural language processing, and data analytics. Meanwhile, we received submissions that use semantic-based methods to tackle critical problems in biomedical informatics such as extracting drug-drug interaction, drug repurposing, adverse drug reaction, detecting early signals for cognitive impairment, and visualizing dietary supplement knowledge. It is thus critical to hold SEPDA workshop annually to continue our momentum and allow researchers to present and discuss novel methods and applications in this fast-growing field. In the previous four years, we held SEPDA in IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 2016, BIBM 2017, BIBM 2018) and International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2019).</p>

Selected papers were invited to publish the extended version to the special issue on “Semantics-Powered Healthcare Engineering and Data Analytics” in the <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/si/461480/" target="_blank">Journal of Healthcare Engineering</a>.</li>

          <li>The 2nd SEPDA Workshop (<a href="http://semantics-powered.org/sepda2017.html" target="_blank">SEPDA
                2017</a>) was held in conjunction with IEEE BIBM 2017 in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. 17 high quality papers were published and presented. About 30 people attended the workshop. Extended journal version of the papers have been published in <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-18-supplement-2" target="_blank">BMC Medical Informatics & Decision Making</a>.</li>

          <li>The 3rd SEPDA Workshop (<a href="http://semantics-powered.org/sepda2018.html" target="_blank">SEPDA
                2018</a>) was held in conjunction with IEEE BIBM 2018 in Madrid, Spain. 14 high quality papers were published and presented. Around 40 people attended the workshop. Extended journal version of the papers has been published in <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-19-supplement-4" target="_blank">BMC Medical Informatics & Decision Making</a>.</li>

          <li>The 4th SEPDA Workshop (<a href="http://semantics-powered.org/sepda2019.html" target="_blank">SEPDA
                2019</a>) was held in conjunction with International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2019) in Auckland, New Zealand. 11 high quality papers were published and presented. Around 40 people attended the workshop. Six extended journal version of the papers will be published in BMC Medical Informatics & Decision Making in July 2020.</li>
