          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The 1st International Workshop on the Semantics of Mental Health (SemanticMH 2018) was successfully organized and hosted in conjunction with the sixth IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI 2018) on June 7th, 2018 in New York City, NY, USA.  Overall, we received 7 high quality submissions and we accepted 6 of them.  The accepted papers were published in the IEEE ICHI 2018 workshop proceedings; and we invited the authors of these 6 accepted papers to submit an extended journal version to a special issue (“Special Issue: Semantics of Mental Health”) in the Health Informatics Journal (IF 3.021).
           All authors presented their work in ICHI 2018; and we have invited two keynote speakers (i.e., Drs. Jessie Tenenbaum and Piper Ranallo) from the Mental Health Informatics Working Group (WG) of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) to present a report from the WG titled, “Mental Health Informatics and Knowledge Representation.”  Overall, SemanticsMH 2018 was highly successful and facilitated the exchange of scholar ideas from a group of interdisciplinary researches.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Mental health is an increasingly important topic in healthcare.  Based on the data from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in the United States 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness, and nearly 1 in 25 live with a serious mental illness.  Mental health issues often lead to serious adverse consequences including suicidality.  The annual suicide rate in the US has climbed over the past several decades, such that suicide is now the 10th leading cause of death and is associated with $51 billion in annual economic impacts.  Further, the rates for many other mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression without suicidality, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders are also alarming. 
          In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the implementation of electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research including those for psychiatric disorders.  Meanwhile, the rapidly increasing, huge archives of consumer data from social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook also provide unprecedented opportunities to access a broad population with mental health issues and suicidality. The real-time information flow on social media makes it possible to monitor and provide early interventions to potential at-risk users, which is imperative for suicide prevention. Therefore, recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of “big data” studies aiming to extract and study risk factors, phenotyping information, and human behaviors from EHRs and social media data.  Nevertheless, these extracted data are rarely standardized and have poor semantic interoperability.  These heterogeneous datasets need to be formally represented using an ontological and semantic framework for downstream analyses, applications, and reasoning.  However, psychiatric information often shows very unique characteristics, such as subjective descriptions of patient experience and idiosyncratic psychosocial backgrounds, leading to challenges of data sparseness and diversity.  Novel natural language processing and ontology technologies are needed to address these challenges.

          <h3>Call For Paper</h3>
          <p>We are inviting original research submissions (FULL 8 pages), work-in-progress (SHORT 4 pages), and poster abstracts (2 pages, NEW TYPE).
              All the accepted submissions will be presented in MentalHealth 2019 and published in the IEEE ICHI 2019 Proceedings (in IEEE Xplore Digital Library); Selected FULL/SHORT papers will be invited to publish an extended version in a special issue of a journal (TBD).  Last year, selected papers were published in the <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/home/jhi" target="_blank">Health Informatics Journal</a> (IF: 3.021). Selected high-quality SHORT papers will also be invited to submit an extended version to the journal supplement for consideration.
              Note: If a paper is selected for possible journal publication, the authors will be asked to shorten their workshop paper to be published in the ICHI 2019 Proceedings and then submit the journal version after the workshop. The authors can still choose to publish their full papers in the conference proceedings, in which case however, the authors will NOT be eligible to publish in the journal supplement due to the journal's self-plagiarism concern.

          <p>Our proposed workshop aims to provide an international platform for the researchers and scientists in the mental health communities to demonstrate research progresses, share ideas, address questions, and promote collaborations for better representation and analysis of mental health-related terminologies and clinical and research data.

          <h3>Workshop Structure</h3>
          <p>We propose a half-day SemanticMH workshop for this year. We will arrange 3 hours for paper presentations and 1 hour for extensive discussions. Different sessions will be arranged based on the topics of presentations. Depending on the number of papers accepted for presentation, each paper presentation will be restricted to 10-25 minutes for a full-length paper, and 5-15 minutes for a short-length paper. All the papers will be submitted and handled through EasyChair and go through peer reviews by at least two reviewers. After the full papers are accepted, we will work with the Health Informatics editors and reviewers to decide which papers will be formally invited for extension to be included in a thematic series in the Health Informatics journal.

          <p>Various methods will be used for advertisement, including: (i) posting in email mailing lists and through private emails; (ii) creating a workshop discussion email list address and using it for sharing news and posting, (iii) posting in influential websites, (iv) phone calls to colleagues and friends who may be interested, (v) generating a workshop website dedicated to this event, and inviting potential attendees to visit, and (vi) generating a social networking website in LinkedIn to attract public attention, participation, and discussion. The main difference between the workshop website and the LinkedIn website will be that the workshop website is dedicated for posting the workshop information, and the LinkedIn website is used for social networking.
