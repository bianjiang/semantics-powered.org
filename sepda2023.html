            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The increasing amount of health-related data pose unprecedented opportunities for mining previously unknown knowledge with semantics-powered data mining and analytical methods. However, due to the heterogeneity of different data sources ranging from electronic health records (EHRs) to environmental exposures, from social determinants of health to social media, it is challenging to exploit and integrate multiple sources to solve real-world problems. Biomedical ontologies and semantics-powered analytical methods are promising solutions. The goal of the 7th International Workshop on Semantics-Powered Data Mining and Analytics (SEPDA 2023) is to bring people in the fields of ontologies, knowledge representation, knowledge management, data mining, and data analytics to discuss a wide range of innovative methods and applications that address problems in healthcare, biomedicine, public health, and clinical research with biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social web data.
            </p>

              We are inviting original research submissions as well as
              work-in-progress to the 7th International Workshop on

                          Dr. Jiang Bian is a Professor of Biomedical
                          Informatics at the University of Florida. He currently
                          serves as the Chief Data Scientist for UF Health,
                          Director of the Cancer Informatics Shared Resource at
                          the UF Health Cancer Center, Associate Director of the
                          Biomedical Informatics Program for the UF Clinical and
                          Translational Science Institute, and the Chief Data
                          Scientist for the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research
                          Consortium. Dr. Bian’s expertise and background serve
                          an overarching theme: data science with heterogeneous
                          data, information and knowledge resources. His
                          research areas can be divided into three logical
                          sections under this overarching theme: (1) data-driven
                          medicine—applications of informatics techniques,
                          including machine learning methods in medicine on
                          solving big data problems; (2) mining the Internet,
                          including the social web, to provide insights into
                          health-related behavior and health outcomes of various
                          populations and finding ways to develop interventions
                          that promote public and consumer health; and (3)
                          development of novel informatics methods, tools and
                          systems to support clinical and clinical research
                          activities such as tools for data integration,
                          clinical trial generalizability assessment, and cohort
                          discovery.

                          Dr. Yi Guo is an Associate Professor in the Department
                          of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics at the
                          University of Florida. He is the Assistant Director of
                          the Cancer Informatics Shared Resource and Director of
                          Data Analytics of the Office of Community Outreach and
                          Engagement at the UF Health Cancer Center, as well as
                          the Assistant Director of the Office of Data Science
                          Research of the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research
                          Consortium. Dr. Guo has a multi-disciplinary
                          background in the analysis of real-world data such as
                          those in electronic health records (EHRs) and
                          administrative claims, experimental and observational
                          study design, predictive modeling (e.g., statistical
                          and machine learning), causal modeling, and analysis
                          of patient-reported outcomes. His research areas and
                          expertise can be divided into three key methodologies:
                          (1) EHR-based phenotyping and risk stratification –
                          the identification of sub-populations with certain
                          conditions or at higher risk for diseases, (2) Causal
                          modeling and inference – the examination of causal
                          relationships and pathways in clinical research,
                          particularly treatment studies, and (3)
                          Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical and
                          public health applications – the development,
                          validation, assessment, analysis, and reporting of
                          PROs among various populations, especially vulnerable
                          populations.
